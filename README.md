This is Project number 4 of the Openclassroom Web Developer Bootcamp. This project required us to utilize our newly acquired SEO and accessibilty skills to modify and optimise an already exsisting website. We had to make at least 10 seo and accessibilty implementation and track the progress made by saving screeshots of Google Lighthouse reports along the way. I deployed my finished project on Netlify, please feel free to visit it here: https://gomikedesign.netlify.app/index.html

You can find the screenshots of the before and after by visiting the folder Google Lighthouse Reports> Reports 0 (before any changes) both the mobile and desktop screenshots are available, then for the optimised version, visit report 3 folder; You should find both the mobile and desktop screenshots.
