This is Project number 4 of the Openclassroom Web Developer Bootcamp. This project required us to utilize our newly acquired SEO and accessibilty skills to modify and optimise an already exsisting website. We had to make at least 10 seo and accessibilty implementation and track the progress made by saving screeshots of Google Lighthouse reports along the way. I deployed my finished project on Netlify, please feel free to visit it here: https://gomikedesign.netlify.app/index.html
